            <p>A mother of two kids. She is an online yoga instructor and a writer. She spends a day with her kids on
                weekends and makes sure to give them a wholesome adventure whenever possible, so she depends on the

                <h3>Jose Nax (22)</h3>
            </li>
            <p> Professional Track and Field Athlete. He trains four times a week indoor/open stadium and three days in
                the outback. He usually depends on his mobile phone to access weather forecasts, routes and adjusts his
                weekly exercise routine plans and safe transportation.</p>

        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>An American businessman is planning a trip to Osaka, Japan, to meet with business partners. The
                    urgency of the meeting cut short his plan into a week. He heard a super typhoon hitting Osaka with
                    landfall time the same day he wished to go. He took out his laptop and inquired KlimaGator for
                    safety options to save the day for his business trip.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A group of doctors decided to provide a 3-day covid vaccination in an open area on a
                    first-come-first-served basis. They offered reservations via the link provided for the public and
                    encouraged everyone to use the link access of KlimaGator to see the weather conditions. The
                    aspirants were guided with the safety travel/ transportation schemes and informed to prepare
                    umbrellas or raincoats according to the weather forecast. They received an update on the weather of
                    the vaccination days.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Local Athletic committee decided to pursue a 5-day athletic meet highlighting the final and
                    championship relays on the fifth day. The chairperson refers to KlimaGator for the best weather
                    options with five consecutive fine days within two weeks of available weather forecasts. They
                    decided to adjust the starting day earlier than planned after knowing that the final day had heavy
                    rainfall. Thanks to KlimaGator.</p>
