        <h2>Ryder Garache(28)</h2>
        <p>A man with a very busy schedule and needs to plan all his work routes. You look for routes in which the weather can not
        be a problem for your trips and you choose important dates and times so that everything goes well with the weather.</p>            
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>A 35-year-old man needs to travel from one city to another at a certain time. These cities are divided by water and
                    the only way to get there is by raft. All this plan is carried out one day before his trip. The day of his trip dawns
                    rainy and very windy and he wants to cancel his trip. At that moment, he decided to look for information about the time
                    his trip was going to leave and he could realize that the forecasts said that the storm would stop just two hours before
                    he traveled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>He rides them, so they are a dangerous place when a rain is coming. A young man is at the top of a mountain, when he
                    suddenly realizes that it will take him an hour to reach the bottom of the mountain. Winds begin to knock down trees and
                    in his mind there was only a thought of regret for not having checked the weather before going up the mountain. But 
                    just at the moment when he thought that one of his relatives came to his rescue since he had checked the weather just
                    when his nephew left home. I carry water and tools with me to protect myself from the storm that would pass through the
                    place for a few minutes.</p>
